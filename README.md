# AquariumOS Database

The AquariumOS Database is primarially used for the purposes of supporting the [AquairumOS](https://github.com/ThatTom/AquariumOS) selfhosted application. It contains a large amount of data relating to fish, plants and other aquarium related items.

## How to use the database?

When used within the AquairumOS application the latest version of this repository is included as part of updates.

If however you wish to use this databse for other puposes for example in your own project then it can be cloned to your local machine or forked if you wish to make your own version.

The Database itself can also be searched directly in Github however please note that the files are saved as XML so not fully human freindly to read and the folder structure acts as below:

- Main Catergory (e.g - Fish)
  - Brand/Scientific Family (e.g Atyidae)
    - File with the Scientific Name (e.g. Caridina Multidentata (Amano Shrimp))

## I have spotted their is something missing, what do I do?

If you spot a fish, plant or even accessory is missing from the list you can either create an issue, using the predefined template or create a new branch with the newly create elements and create a pull request to be reviewed, if you also have any questions about either of these please feel free to join our Discord where someone will be able to help you.
